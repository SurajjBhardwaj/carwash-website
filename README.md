## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that leverages the MERN stack to create a modern and interactive website. MERN is a powerful combination of technologies for building web applications, with MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the server, React for the front end, and Node.js for the runtime.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization.
- Database integration with MongoDB for storing and retrieving data.
- Front-end built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- RESTful API for communication between the client and server.
- Routing and navigation for a seamless user experience.
- User-friendly forms for data input and interaction.
- Modern styling and design for an appealing user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): The JavaScript runtime for both the server and client.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for storing data.
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any of your choice).

## Getting Started

To set up and run the MERN stack website, follow these steps:

 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-website.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
     cd mern-website
   ```
3. create a .env file
  ```bash
    touch dotenv
  ```
3. Install the server dependencies:


```bash
    npm install
```

4. install frontend dependency: 
   ```bash
      cd frontend
   ```

    ```bash
         npm install
    ```
Note : .env file only contains till now I'll update what will be added later 
   ```bash
        PORT=5001
   ```

### how to start now 
for backend 
make sure you're in root folder means 'carwash-website/'

    ```bash
         npm start
     ```

for frontend create one more terminal in the same directory and now navigate to the frontend folder using 
     ```bash
          cd frontend
     ```

now run the frontend 

    ```bash
         npm run dev
    ```

So now ## happy hacking

Start the server and client development servers concurrently:

    ```bash
        npm run dev
    ```
The MERN stack website should now be up and running. Access the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

arduino

```
bash

mern-website/
│
├── frontend/         # React front-end code
│
├── backend/         # Express.js back-end code
│
├── README.md       # Documentation (this file)
```

The frontend directory contains the React front-end code.
The backend directory contains the Express.js back-end code.
You can add your routes, controllers, components, and other code in their respective directories.

### Usage
You can start building your website by adding components, routes, and styles to the client directory. Use the server directory to define your routes, data models, and server logic.

### Deployment
i will update, keep in touch
